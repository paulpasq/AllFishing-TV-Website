# AllFishing-TV-Website
This is a web development course final project. Tasked with creating a professional looking website using bootstrap framework along with some custom CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to make a website for my friend who runs a large fishing YouTube channel. Because it is a website that is supposed to be an extension of the YouTube channel, it needed to be able to connect with fans in other ways than just one platform. Therefore, the website was built with social media first mentality.
